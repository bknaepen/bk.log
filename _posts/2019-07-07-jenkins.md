**Installing Jenkins on MacOS X 10.14.5 (Mojave)**

Since I wanted to start playing around with an automation server, I decided today to install Jenkins.

For future reference, here are the simple steps to follow:

1) First make sure you have Java working. Jenkins lists in the requirements that either a Java JRE or JDK is needed. I first tried installing Oracle's JRE but could not run Jenkins after completing step 2. So I tried with Oracle's JDK and that did the trick (Java SE Development Kit 12.0.1).

2) I then installed Jenkins 2.176.1 following the instructions provided on Jenkins' site.

3) To launch Jenkins just type: `java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=8080 --enable-future-java` , in a terminal window and paste `http://localhost:8080 in a web browser`.
